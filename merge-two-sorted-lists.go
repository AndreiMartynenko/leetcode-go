21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists in a one sorted list.
The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

BIG-O NOTATION

In computer science, Big O notation is used to describe
the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
It represents the upper bound or worst-case scenario of the algorithm's
time or space requirements as the input size grows.
O(1), pronounced "big O of one" or "constant time," represents an algorithm
that takes a constant amount of time to run, regardless of the input size.
It means that the algorithm's execution time remains the same,
regardless of whether there are 10 elements or 10 million elements to process.
This is considered the most efficient time complexity.

An example of an O(1) algorithm is accessing an element in an array by its index.
It requires a simple calculation to retrieve the desired element,
and the time it takes does not depend on the size of the array.

O(n), pronounced "big O of n" or "linear time," represents an algorithm
whose execution time grows linearly with the input size.
It means that as the input size increases,
the execution time of the algorithm also increases proportionally.
If an algorithm has O(n) complexity, doubling the input size
will roughly double the execution time.

An example of an O(n) algorithm is searching for a specific value in an unsorted array
by iterating through each element until a match is found.
In the worst case, where the desired element is at the end of the array or not present at all,
the algorithm needs to check each element,
resulting in a linear relationship between the input size and execution time.

In summary, O(1) represents constant time complexity,
indicating an algorithm that executes in the same amount of time regardless of the input size.
O(n) represents linear time complexity, where the execution time grows linearly with the input size.
